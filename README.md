computer vision for mushroom recognition

This repository contains:
two differents way to train and deploy the model resnet34 for mushroom recognition,
one for render and the other for AWS sage maker.

I use the Latin name of mushrooms to select images from the internet.
A poisonous class concerns all inedible or poor mushrooms, this allows us to increase the model's accuracy
a Trompette chanterelle girolle class are use, the mushrooms are from the same family.

I use the pre-trained model Resnet-34 Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
