computer vision for mushroom recognition

This repository contains:
two differents way to train and deploy the model for mushroom recognition,
one for render and the other for AWS sage maker.

I use the Latin name of mushrooms to select images from the internet.
A poisonous class concerns all inedible or poor mushrooms, this allows us to increase the model's accuracy
a Trompette_chanterelle_girolle class is use, the mushrooms are from the same family.

I use the pre-trained model Resnet-34 of fastai Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

The fastai library simplifies training fast and accurate neural nets using modern best practices. See the fastai website to get started. The library is based on research into deep learning best practices undertaken at fast.ai, and includes "out of the box" support for vision, text, tabular, and collab (collaborative filtering) models.
